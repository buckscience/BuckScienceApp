## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Storage Optimization

#### Lifecycle Management
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "TempCleanup",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["trail-camera-originals/"]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "delete": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 1
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ArchiveOldPhotos",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["trail-camera-processed/"]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToArchive": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 365
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Annual Savings**: 40-60% on long-term storage costs

#### Geographic Distribution
- Use cheaper regions for archive storage
- Implement geo-replication only where necessary
- Consider single-region storage for non-critical data

**Cost Impact**: 15-25% reduction in storage costs

### 2. Compute Optimization

#### Function App Scaling Strategy
```csharp
// Optimal scaling configuration
{
  "functionAppScaleLimit": 20,
  "scaleOutCooldown": "00:05:00",
  "scaleInCooldown": "00:30:00",
  "targetWorkerCount": 1,
  "maximumElasticWorkerCount": 20
}
```

#### Processing Efficiency
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple photos in single function execution
- **Parallel Processing**: Generate thumbnail and display images concurrently
- **Memory Optimization**: Stream processing instead of loading entire files
- **Warm Instances**: Keep functions warm during peak upload times

**Cost Impact**: 30-40% reduction in compute costs

### 3. Data Transfer Optimization

#### CDN Configuration
- Implement aggressive caching for processed images
- Use CDN for thumbnail delivery (high frequency)
- Direct blob access for display images (lower frequency)
- Enable compression for all image deliveries

**Cost Impact**: 50-70% reduction in data transfer costs

#### Regional Strategy
- Deploy processing functions in same region as storage
- Use regional CDN endpoints
- Implement smart routing based on user location

### 4. Queue Optimization

#### Message Retention
```csharp
// Optimized queue settings
{
  "thumbnailQueue": {
    "timeToLive": "01:00:00",    // Reduced from default
    "lockDuration": "00:05:00"   // Faster processing
  },
  "displayQueue": {
    "timeToLive": "04:00:00",    // Reasonable for delayed processing
    "lockDuration": "00:10:00"
  }
}
```

#### Batch Operations
- Process multiple messages per function invocation
- Use Service Bus batching for cost efficiency
- Implement dead letter queue monitoring

**Cost Impact**: 20-30% reduction in messaging costs

## Budget Monitoring & Alerts

### Cost Alert Configuration

```json
{
  "budgets": [
    {
      "name": "TrailCameraProcessing-Monthly",
      "amount": 200,
      "timeGrain": "Monthly",
      "alerts": [
        {
          "threshold": 80,
          "contactEmails": ["admin@buckscience.com"],
          "actionGroup": "CostAlerts"
        },
        {
          "threshold": 95,
          "contactEmails": ["admin@buckscience.com"],
          "actionGroup": "CriticalAlerts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Cost per photo processed**
2. **Storage growth rate**
3. **Function execution costs**
4. **Data transfer costs**
5. **Queue operation costs**

### Automated Cost Optimization

#### Resource Tagging Strategy
```json
{
  "tags": {
    "Project": "TrailCameraProcessing",
    "Environment": "Production",
    "CostCenter": "Wildlife-Research",
    "AutoShutdown": "Enabled",
    "DataRetention": "365-days"
  }
}
```

#### Scheduled Resource Management
- Auto-scale down during low usage periods
- Pause non-critical processing during maintenance windows
- Implement resource cleanup for abandoned uploads
